# API Driven Development

## Chapters

### 01. Preparing your environment

In this chapter you'll have the opportunity to get familiar with nodejs. Here you'll learn the following:

* The basics of JavaScript
* The basics of node (asynchronous i/o, http, stream)
* The basics of npm
* The basics of Git and GitHub

### 02. Hello TodoMVC

The example we will be following is based on making the modern `Hello World` -- the TodoMVC frontend application. To start off our API, we will begin by mocking a JSON data store.

### 03. A brief introduction to web frameworks with Koa

We chose Koa since it is a very small framework that enables you to write simple, yet powerful APIs using the node modules ecosystem.

### 04. CRUD endpoints

In this example, we'll set up a few endpoints for our application. They will allow us to: list todos, add a todo, update a todo and delete a todo.

### 05. Testing your API like a pro

When it comes to Software Development there is nothing more valuable than a fast and well done test suite. In this chapter we'll introduce you to integration testing where you can understand how to develop software without being afraid of breaking things.

### 06. Nothing is finished until its perfect

A good project needs at least an `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` and well-defined coding standards (eg: `.jshintrc`).
